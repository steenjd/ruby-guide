# How to Install Ubuntu Linux in Oracle VM VirtualBox

Software versions used when writing this guide,
referenced here in case future versions are incompatible with the instructions:
- Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.0.10
- Ubuntu Desktop 19.04
- Windows 10 as the host OS (but these instructions should work with any host OS)

## Download the Ubuntu Linux installation disk image

https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

In this guide, we'll use the desktop version of Ubuntu 19.04 64-bit.
This is the non-LTS version, which will have the latest versions
of packaged software and will be upgradable to the next Ubuntu release
within six months.

Later, you will attach the downloaded ISO disk image
to your Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) as a virtual optical disc.

## Install VirtualBox

Download and install VirtualBox from Oracle.

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html

## Create a virtual machine for Linux

Launch VirtualBox.

From the Machine menu, choose New.

Name your new VM "Ubuntu" or whatever you would like to call it.

Choose Type "Linux" and Version "Ubuntu 64-bit". These will be selected
automatically if you entered a virtual machine name containing "Ubuntu".

Memory (RAM): Minimum 2048 MB (2 GB), preferably 3 GB if your host system
can spare it. When the Ubuntu VM starts, this amount of memory will be taken
from the available free memory of your host OS. (In Windows, you can
check available free memory in Task Manager; in macOS, use Activity Manager.)

Create a virtual hard disk with a size of 20 GB.
Choose one of the recommended (bold) hard disk file types.
VDI is native to VirtualBox, and VHD is a disk image format that Windows
can operate on through Computer Management.
You can convert between formats later if needed.

## Customize the virtual machine settings

Open the Settings for your new VM.

System category:
- Motherboard tab:
  - Boot Order: Move the Hard Disk entry so it's higher in the list than Optical
  (both should be enabled). This will prevent you from accidentally booting
  from the attached CD/DVD image after your Ubuntu OS is installed.
  - Enable EFI (optional). This is a more modern system boot loader technology
  than the older variant, MBR.
- Processor tab:
  - Processor(s): Drag the slider as high as it can go in the green region
  (optional). This lets your VM make use of multiple CPU cores.
  - Enable PAE/NX. If the guest OS supports it, regions of data memory
  can be marked "no execute" (NX) to prevent certain types of malware attacks
  such as buffer overruns.
- Acceleration tab:
  - Paravirtualization Interface: KVM. This is
  [recommended for Linux guest OSes](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#gimproviders).

Storage category:
- Storage Devices: Select the CD icon (probably labeled "Empty").
- Attributes: Optical Drive: Tap the CD icon to open its drop-down menu,
and select the Choose Virtual Optical Disk File option. Browse to and select
the Ubuntu ISO image file you downloaded at the start of this guide,
provided the download has completed.

Tap OK.

## Install Ubuntu Linux to the virtual machine

Start your new Ubuntu VM. It should boot from the virtual optical drive
and start the Ubuntu installer.

Make a note of the "host key" displayed in the bottom-right corner
of the VirtualBox VM window. On Windows, it's Right Ctrl.
While the VM window has focus, your keyboard input will go to the VM.
To release the VM's keyboard capture, press the host key once,
and then you can use host OS key combos like Alt-Tab to switch to another app.
You can also click with your mouse on another app
to release the keyboard capture.

At the GNU GRUB menu, choose the Install Ubuntu option.

Choose your preferred language and keyboard layout.

Choose the "Minimal installation" option for which set of apps to install.

Installation type: Erase disk and install Ubuntu. "Use LVM" is optional;
LVM makes it easier to add space to your Linux virtual disk later
if it fills up, and it's a good technology to learn for server maintenance.

Choose a username and password for signing in to your Ubuntu system
for everyday use. This will be a limited user account, but it will have
`sudo` privileges for running administrative commands as `root`.

Installation will take several minutes. Restart when prompted.
The installer will ask you to remove the installation medium,
but the virtual optical disc should have ejected automatically
and you can just press Enter.

Choose Ubuntu at the GRUB boot menu to boot into your new Linux VM.

## Configure Ubuntu

After tapping your username at the login screen,
tap the gear icon and choose the Wayland option.
The initially default, non-Wayland option has buggy screen drawing routines
with some combinations of video drivers. The Wayland option will remain
the new default across reboots.

Log in with the username and password you created during Ubuntu installation.

If Software Updater pops up at any time, install all offered updates.

Whenever prompted for your password for administrative tasks
such as installing software, enter the password you used to sign in to Ubuntu.

Pin the Terminal app to the "favorites" launcher bar
so the app is easier to start. In the apps menu (icon with nine dots
at bottom-left), choose Utilities, right-click (or long-tap) Terminal,
and choose "Add to Favorites".

To increase the VM's display resolution, launch the Settings app,
go to the Devices category, Displays subcategory, and change Resolution
to a larger size that fits inside your physical screen.
You can choose a resolution that matches that of your physical screen,
but then you will need to toggle fullscreen view on your VM
to avoid scrolling the VM display: press the host key plus F (RightCtrl-f)
to toggle fullscreen, or choose the Full-screen Mode option
from the VM window's View menu.

## Install VirtualBox Guest Additions

This step is optional.

Installing [VirtualBox Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html)
in Ubuntu allows for more convenient interaction between VM host and guest:
- When you resize the VM window, the Ubuntu guest display resolution
will resize automatically to match.
- Text copied in the host OS can be natively pasted inside the Ubuntu VM
and vice versa. This is useful if you are reading this guide in the host OS
and need to paste commands into the Ubuntu guest.
- Share files between host and guest via a shared folder or drag and drop.

To install Guest Additions, go to the Devices menu of your VM window
and select "Insert Guest Additions CD image".
Choose Run when prompted to automatically run software from the "VBox_GAs_â€¦" CD.
The installer might display errors about not being able to build kernel modules,
but this is okay; the aforementioned host/guest integration features
will still work.

After installation, you can enable these features in the Devices menu
of your running Ubuntu VM window.
